                            Courteous and enthusiastic. I am fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites.
                             I am well versed in React Components and frameworks .
                             I am able to use Redux to handle app complexities and construct. 
                             I also have strong understanding of Express.Js and nodeJs to effectively build server-side technologies
                             with node package manager libraries and frameworks. I understand the required structure of a full project, 
                            making HTTP request and response using CRUD operations, building API and deployment.
